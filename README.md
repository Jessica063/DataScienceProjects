# Data Science Projects Repository

Welcome to my **Data Science Projects** repository! This repository contains various projects that cover essential concepts and practical applications in data science, including data preprocessing, deep learning, optimization techniques, and model deployment.

## Projects Overview

### 1. Data Pipeline: Preprocessing, Transformation, and Loading
- **Description**: This project focuses on building a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** pipeline for handling raw data.
- **Tools Used**: Pandas, Scikit-learn
- **Key Features**:
  - Data cleaning and missing value imputation
  - Feature engineering and transformation
  - Data normalization and standardization
  - Exporting processed data for further analysis

### 2. Deep Learning Model for Image Classification/NLP
- **Description**: Implementation of a deep learning model for either **image classification** or **natural language processing (NLP)**.
- **Tools Used**: TensorFlow/PyTorch
- **Key Features**:
  - Data augmentation and preprocessing
  - Model architecture design using CNNs (for image classification) or RNNs/Transformers (for NLP)
  - Training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
  - Model performance analysis
